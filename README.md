![App preview in different themes](./design/preview.jpg)

## üìñ Description

_A beautiful and interactive browser extension manager UI built as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge. In this project, users can filter, remove, and toggle extensions. Developed with React, TypeScript, and styled-components for a type-safe, clean, and component-based styling approach._

This is my first project developed with Typescript. It was fun discovering new ways to keep my code type-safe and cleaner. Dealing with constant squiggly lines was a little annoying, but it was worth it üòÖ. Last but not least, I tried to put as much focus as possible on the accessibility aspects of this project. I tested it with a screen reader (NVDA) in different browsers to make sure everything was working as intended.
